We know that for each chemical other than ore, there is exactly one reaction to create that chemical.

Reformat Part 1 to think about: How much ore might we find if we destroyed one fuel?

Keep track of the amount of each chemical available: Starting with FUEL=1 and all else 0

if we come across a chemical other than ore with available amount > 0, we apply a reaction
to destroy that chemical (the "reverse" of the unique reaction used to create it).

It's fine if a chemical amount is < 0, as this is the amount "extra" of the chemical we would expect
to make with our ore while making fuel. A problem might arise if the chemical amount is negative
and less than the amount we would create in its reaction, but this can never happen because
the only way to lower the amount of a chemical is to destroy it, and we will only destroy it
if its amount is > 0.

Once ORE is the only chemical with a positive available amount, that amount of ore is the least amount of
ore that can be used to create one fuel. It clearly can't be more than that, since we just decomposed
a fuel into that much ore. If the correct answer were smaller, we would expect to not need to do
one of the intermediate reactions, but from above we can prove that's not the case either.
